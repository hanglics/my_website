I am currently pursuing the PhD degree at <a href="https://ielab.io" target="_blank">ielab</a> in The University of Queensland, Australia, supervised by <a href="http://ielab.io/people/guido-zuccon" target="_blank">Dr. Guido Zuccon</a> and <a href="http://koopman.id.au/" target="_blank">Dr. Bevan Koopman</a>. I was graduated from the University of Minnesota Twin-Cities with my Bachelor of Science degree in United States in 2016.

For my PhD study, my main focus is to develop different machine learning approaches to improve the effectiveness in conversational search settings, my broader research topics include conversational AI, multi-modal system, and natural language understanding.

My publications are listed in this page along with corresponding github repos.
